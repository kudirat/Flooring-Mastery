# Flooring-Mastery

## Overview
The goal of this mastery project was to create an application that can read and write flooring orders for Wiley Edge Corp.
I used N-tier development and MVC principles to structure my code to handle products, taxes, and orders appropriately. This application follows the MVC pattern.
I used unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the application's data layers and business logic (service layer) code was covered.
